- A tale of two sons\" is a well renowned game and one of the indie darlings from 2013. I recently played through it\nand can now give my assessment of this. Normally I do not care about spoiler warnings as I assume everybody does either not care\nor already knows the game. Second, most spoiler warning can actually already be a spoiler. Here I might break with my tradition.\nAfter a break there will be full spoilers, you are warned.\nI should also mention that the game did not quite capture me as many other people. The reasons are many fold. I wanted\nto finish this highly acclaimed game already and know what people are talking about.\n\nBut let us now go into the meat of the game. The interesting mechanic with this is, that you control two characters with the same\ncontroller at the same time. The left stick is for the bigger brother and the right stick for the smaller one. Left bumper for\nthe action of one character and right bumper for the action of the other character. Now go venture forth and solve puzzles with\nthese two characters. And venture forth to find a cure for your ill father.\nAnd here the story already begins to falter. While you go through the village it is still fine but the further you get away\nyou just have to think about how you get back. Climbing a mountain with the help of a troll is good and all but how do you get\nback? Or when you fly and crash your plane to get over an enormous chasm? The illness of the father seems to be more a starting\npoint than anything else and that would be fine if the game wouldn't cut back to him a few times to remind you how sick he is. Oh\nbut don't worry we got a deus ex machina that will solve this at the end of the game.\nBut it does not stop there. After all the environment also tells a story. A story about how you need to save a troll wife from other\nsupposedly evil trolls. Are they evil? What are they doing? Forget about them, the next environment is already there, a giants house.\nOh cool, I am going to see the giant? Run away from him? No. You are now in a viking battlefield already! And so it goes on, throwing\nfantasy stuff one after each other without doing anything with it except giving a nice backdrop.\nBut one thing has to be mentioned about the story. The twist. The twist I saw coming a mile away. The older brother dies. Why the older?\nBecause the younger relies on him. Why does anybody die? Because the game trained you to use two characters. But ok even good twists\ndo not make a good story moment necessarily so let us look how it uses the mechanics to tell the story. And here it is actually quite good\nbut short. The first few times you run around without your brother your left thumb feels weirdly out of place. Like you are supposed to\ndo something but there is nothing. A weirdly isolating feeling. Then you have to bury your brother which did not leave a big impression\non me but that could be completely my fault. The only scene which left an impression is the water scene after it. The little brother is\nafraid of water and does not want to swim without his brother caring him (by holding the left bumper). Now without the brother\nonly by holding the left bumper you can swim through it, only if you remember your older brother to give you strength to conquer your fear.\nThat was actually a nice moment. There are some other nice moments in the minute the game let you lose without the older brother.\nSadly I think the game is missing something here. There are only four, maybe five things you have to do without your older brother.\nWouldn't it be better if you have to go back at least a part of the journey? Seeing all the things you conquer with him together\nto remind you and where you now have to find a new, solution just for yourself? Some solutions which might be even easier, reminding\nyou how annoying it could be to get both characters somewhere. And, of course, some which are now even harder which need a\ncreative solution. Instead it seems to stop right before the emotional impact.\nAnd it does not help that the game has quite a chopped up feel to it. Here, solve this one puzzle. Done? Good watch a cutscene. Look at\nthe camera work. And let us slowly go back to the game. And here you are allowed to play some more for a few minutes. Instead of letting\nthe death of the older brother play out you have to play, watch, play, watch, play, watch.\nBut in the end, the ending has some impact and I was happy to have played this game.\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2015/brothers-in-the-nick-of-time/","title":"Brothers - In the Nick of Time"},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2015/e3-and-the-marketing-monster/":{"body":"And upon us is the current E3. The marketing machine is buzzing, the internet is excited, everybody is watching the keynotes.\nAt the moment I only watched the Bethesda Keynote with all their glory but I am sitting ready for the Microsoft one. Why am I watching\nthese? Because they are lame and funny and crazy and a lot more.\n\nI warn you before that this will behind a rant and a description why I still watch these.\nSo lets go over what does a good E3 press conference need? Every\nkeynote needs at least some presenter who is trying to hard to be in,\nto understand all that hippity-hoppety the young kids are into these\ndays. \"No, really I play the calls of duty and the halos and that one\nindie game with the time thingy.\" But they try so hard, oh so hard to\nconvince us that they actually know what they are talking about. And\ndo not forget the appropriate nerdy t-shirt.\nNow ok I don't know how many games they played and in fact i don't care. But forcing some guy to do that is not really nice and it is\nplain obvious. Look at the Doom reveal on the Bethesda Keynote. How hard he convinced us that Doom is about bad ass killing demons. And\nweapons and killing demons. Did I mention demons? But that seems so far away from the techical, game-feel essence of the game.\nBut ok not everybody can know every game and after all this is a marketing thing going on and we should just concentrate on the games.\nBut after a new announcement we get to see a trailer and two people from the development studio got the bad end of the stick (or good perhaps?\nI don't know how good the parties are) and have to sell us on this. Telling us how awesome Game 1 was and Game 2 will be because they clearly\nunderstand the essence of the game. Oh and don't you remember how much fun you had with the last game? Remember that because that is our selling\npoint. But don't worry, they have soooo much more to tell us and they \"cannot wait\". But don't wait because you are going to get none in the\nnext few month. Because they might have some ideas what\nthis will be or if the features/vertical slice/trailer will have anything to do with the end product. And of course the marketing department\nforbid us to tell you anything anyway.\nOk after all this marketing we at least have an enjoyable show, right? Well. Not really. Unless you like to hear weird puns and jokes going\nnowhere? And you know what? I am! So let's see what Microsoft has to offer.\nAfter Peak Balmer\nOh I forgot something. The good old \"do you remember that old game you played? You can now play the same game again! With free nostalgia.\"\nAnd of course the technical glitches which always find their way into these conferences. You might think they found capable people to\nget one press conference\nwithout any technical hiccups. And my favorite thing was also back again. The completely real demo, look guys I have a controller in my hands\nwhich then is full of either scripted CGI sequences or scripted interaction sequences.\nBut let us just wait for EA. Because EA has always a fun show.\nElectronic Awwww\nWell and here is the EA press conference. The most fun one. And I really have to wonder who decides what gets on stages and what the order is.\nBecause they are not dumb. They know people wait for Battlefront so they remind people about when this will come. But on the other hand they\nspent their precious minutes on mobile building game. And instead of having the interview with a star somewhere at the start so they can\nchange the timings around things if he goes over time. And it is exactly this weird mixture of not understanding anything and\ncompletely understanding what the people want to see. It is just baffeling how these things can exists in a 90 minutes conference. How the timer\njust reminds you that you are only here for Battlefront. Which is completely counter intuitive how these things should be. The viewer should\nhang at what comes next, always asking themselves if they miss something. But a timer completely invalidates this. I just can't understand\nthis.\nAnd the rest\nWell and the rest. I should mention I like the Ubisoft show. I always like it because at least the presenter is not boring. And they\nknow that you should show stuff instead of just telling me how awesome they are. But, of course, they need to do something nobody cares about.\nBut this is how these press events go. Multimillion dollar companies show how they really cannot give us a show that seems professional and\ninteresting without any hiccups.\nBut I am loving it!\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2015/e3-and-the-marketing-monster/","title":"E3 and the Marketing Monster"},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2015/player-disconnet-and-the-last-of-us/":{"body":"\n\"The Last Of Us\" got wide critical acclaim from most gaming press and even most independent reviewers and analysts claim it a landmark of the current genre. Most of them mention that the ludonarrative dissonance which plagues a lot of modern games was careful avoided. The story is about a fight for survival in a world without any resources and enemies all around and the gameplay is about the same aspects. It is fast, deadly and easily ends in panic. When you sneak up on the next infected, gathering all the supplies you can find, you wonder just how you are going to get past them with only a nailbomb and 3 shotgun shells.\n\nHowever, there is one scene where I and probably most player felt a disconnect. I want to argue for this disconnect. It is a stylistic choice and not just the developers screwing up.\nThe disconnect happens in the last act. Joel tries to rescue Ellie which is going to die on the operating table for a cure for humanity. You start this sequence while fighting through a bunch of enemies. This is a natural ramp-up in the difficulty and feels a bit forced. Despite this, the sequence still worked for me. Joel tries to get to Ellie just because he wants to see her or rescue her. Notice how the motive of Joel is not made clear. The player doesn't know if the game will give you a last goodbye or a suicide rescue mission. This ambiguity gives rise to questions in the player's mind. Is it really worth all this to \"rescue\" Ellie? Should I really just murder these last few humans just for a fleeting moment? Or should I just give up?\nAfter you fought your way through them you burst into the operating room. There she is, laying unconscious surrounded by doctors. You have the choice and the choice is taken from you. You have to kill one doctor. He will not step down. And here the disconnect starts. If you kill the doctor there is no fooling yourself into thinking Joel just wanted to see Ellie one last time. No, Joel wants something different then you. But still the choice is not completely taken from you. You can decide what you do with the other doctors. Do you kill them or let them live? Is the murder of the first doctor perhaps still explainable by the players world view? After all, the game made you do it.\nYou carry Ellie to the outside. The player carries her. But now the players mind starts to race. \"This is a mistake. I know this already. I played this already. I know how this ends.\" And the most powerful thought: \"I don't want to do this!\"g\nThis scene mirrors the first sequence in the game. The sequence where Joel is trying to save his daughter but ends up killing her by accident. The player already saw what happens. You will probably just be shot down by some unknown guard killing Ellie in the process. Nothing is won and the last hope of humanity lost. And here is the disconnect. The game forces the player to do something he/she doesn't want to do. You are made aware that you are not Joel. You where never him. The players thoughts and Joel thoughts just temporary aligned.\nAnd this disconnect stays in your mind. The whole sequence you are painfully aware of what Joel has done and what you, the player, would have done. How these two ideas clash and how Joel's plan is destined for failure. But still the game forces you to do it. Because it wants you to ask yourself why any human being would act like Joel did. The last scene of the game just reinforces this.\nThis is, to me at least, one of the most powerful scenes in the game and one of the advantages in interactive media. But this scene wouldn't work in a movie. In a movie the disconnect is always there. You are watching somebody else story. But in a game you lie to yourself that these are all your actions.\nWe are always talking about ludonarrative dissonance and how mechanics should tell a story but the discussion seems to be outright exclusive of approaches to conveying meaning with interactivity. Approaches which don't rely on translating mechanics to meaning but use the human mind to transfer meaning.\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2015/player-disconnet-and-the-last-of-us/","title":"Player Disconnect and The Last of Us"},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2015/they-bleed-pixels-the-hardcore-casual-platformer/":{"body":"\nI was recently playing \"They Bleed Pixels\" which at the first glance is just another 2D hardcore platformer like \"Super Meat Boy\". However after some time I noticed that the execution is very different.\nSuper Meat Boy has the big problem that the length of the levels increases by a lot as you go on which can lead to a lot of frustration. One of the big reasons Super Meat Boy works and is so successful is that the reset time and repeat time is very short. Any time you die you are immediately back to the start. If you are stuck at a specific part of the level you don't need a long time to get back to it. These two things are the major differences between old school platformers and new school. Old school fights the players while new school wants the player to succeed.\n\nBut back to They Bleed Pixels. The game has similar mechanics as Super Meat Boy but the levels are much, much longer. However, if you fill an energy bar and stand still for a few seconds when nothing is around you, you create a save point. Your energy fills either by combat or by pickups. But this save point is a full fledged save. You can quit the game and can get back to the same save point.\n\nThis mechanic leads to a very short repeat time and makes your play very much checkpoint based. Anytime you get over your current hurdle in the level, you are very close to a good save point. Coupled with the fact that you can just quit the game after this probably frustrating few minutes. The developers combined this with giving you some simple combat rooms after you beat a hard part of the level. It really feels like a more casual \"hardcore platformer\".\n\nThe only question left to ponder is how hardcore you can push this concept. This game blocks the save point at some points but never strays far away from its core concept. The sections as far as I played (the start of chapter 4) are short while still being difficult.\nIt seems to deny the general mode of increasing the difficulty by just increasing the level size and instead focuses on pure execution. Can you make an interesting difficulty curve just by this? Can you make a save anywhere platformer?\nSadly, the game has some flaws. The combat controls are all mapped to one button modified with directional input. This is honestly atrocious and the I can't understand the reason behind this.\nBut if you can live with these flaws you are given a nice platformer. More and more I see myself starting it after a long gaming session to just get to the next checkpoint.\n[1] \"They Bleed Pixels\" on http://www.theybleedpixels.com/ (Logo)\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2015/they-bleed-pixels-the-hardcore-casual-platformer/","title":"They Bleed Pixels - The Hardcore Casual Platformer"},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2015/tomb-raider-and-the-quick-event-of-time/":{"body":"\nQuick time events are generally shunned in the gaming population. And even people open to different concepts hate them. I want to argue for quick time events on the example of \"Tomb Raider\" (2013).\nQuick time events have the unique position emulating an action without a special controller required. The greatest example is probably Heavy Rain. Every movement translates to joystick movement or other controller input. And the input makes sense. If you need to brush your teeth you push the stick up and down in unison with animation. Every QTE in Heavy Rain uses movement which maps almost isomorphic to the real event happening on the screen. And because of this isomorphism our brain can see the event as a tool [1] and not just a weird input method. And if our brain sees this action as a tool we are more likely to immerse our self in the world.\n\nTomb Raider is more conservative. No complicated joystick or mouse movements and no mundane activities to emulate. However, it is consistent. If you need to do something with your feet you have to use your \"feet\" button. If you need your hands, your \"hands\" button which is also used for steadying your grip or hacking your pickaxe into a wall. It is not just a Simon Says game but a consistent input method. This lays the foundation of a good QTE system. In contrast, consistency is rarely found in the standard QTE system. Instead of the player being immersed he is not only surprised by the appearance of a QTE but also by which button he has to press. Combine this with strict time constraints, QTE are made to be a challenge instead of a gameplay asset.\nBut the QTE system in Tomb Raider becomes excellent by one scene in the middle of the game. Lara falls down from a helicopter and needs to pull her parachute. This is again consistent for asking you to push the \"hands\" button. You push it, the parachute deploys but breaks. Now you are in a mad scramble to pull the included safety parachute. And now the game brilliantly asks you to push the shift button. A different button as the hands button (e), a different button than the feet button (f) and really a button that is not used in any other quick time event but still a normal control button. Suddenly you, the player, is in a mad scramble to find the right button, to find the correct string for the second parachute. This is the game connecting directly with the player. When I first saw the unfamiliar prompt I uttered a curse word at the screen. And not because the game just pulled a cheap trick.\nThe poison of quick time events\nBut quick time events have a major draw back. They will poison your whole game. Imagine there being no other quick time events in the whole game except the parachute one. The whole sequence would just feel cheap. A sudden surprise and disconnect from your control of the game. Like if a First Person Shooter would suddenly turn into a Super Meat Boy for a few seconds.\nThis means you need to litter your game with quick time events. They need to happen often enough such that the player does not forget they exist and notices the consistency of your control scheme. While you can make them expressive, in sync with the action on-screen and consistent, you can't make every event engaging. At least not in a game with good core mechanics.\nAnd this is the greatest downfall of the quick time events in Tomb Raider. They happen to often and feel just like busy work for you to do something while the game shows a cutscene. You just want to get back to the gunplay.\nI hope this showed that QTE systems should not be dismissed just because they are different input methods but viewed on their own, critiqued like any other gameplay element.\n\n[1] Extra Credits: Kinect Disconnect http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/kinect-disconnect\n[2] Tomb Raider (2013) http://www.tombraider.com (Logo)\n\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2015/tomb-raider-and-the-quick-event-of-time/","title":"Tomb Raider and the Quick Event of Time"},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2018/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2018/","title":""},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2018/abp-general-lowerbound-overview/":{"body":"References:\n\n(Allender, Wang - On the power of algebraic branching programs of width 2)[https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2011/083/]\nI modified this proof significantly, hence I cannot vouch for correctness of my thoughts.\n\nTheorem:\nFor all $k\\geq 8$ $\\sum_{i=1}^k x_{2i-1}x_{2i} + l(x)$ for any linear form $l(x)$ cannot be computed by an algebraic branching program of width 2.\nPreqrequisites:\n\nLet an SLP on two registers be denoted by $m_1 \\dots m_m$.\nNotice that an SLP in general, could set registers to zero which matrices cannot do.

(Kaltofen 89)\nDeterministic algorithms are unkown.\n\nShpilka, Volkovich\n\nMultilinear Circuits\nTheorem: Assume we have a deterministic PIT for a circuit of the form $C_1 + C_2\\times C_3$ where $C_i$ are $(n,s,d)$ circuits with running time $T(s,d)$. Then we have a deterministic factoring algoirhtms that outputs the factors (in circuit form) in time polynomial in $n,d, T(s,d)$. Additionally, the size of each factor is bounded by $s$.\n\nPreliminaries\n\nPolynomial sized circuits with polynomial degree on $n$ variables.\nPIT: Is such a circuit identically to the zero polynomial.\nPIT produce circuit lower bounds (boolean or algebraic) and the other way around.\nDepth of a circuit.\nIf there is a deterministic algorithm that outputs \"true\" if a given circuit is decomposable, then there is a deterministic algorithm that decides PIT. (This is obvious, as $f+yz$ is not decomposable into factors if it is not zero for new variables $y,z$.)\nNote that it is enough to find out the index sets as we are multilinear.\nAssume the field is large enough.\n$f$ depends on $x_i$ when there exists $a,b$ such that $f(a)\\neq f(a_1,\\dots,a_{i-1},b,a_{i+1},\\dots, a_n)$.\n$var(f) = { i \\mid \\text{f depends on $x_i$} }$.\nVariable Partition: Let $I$ be a partition. Then a variable partition of $f$ is such that $f=h_1(X_{I_1})\\cdots h_k(X_{I_k})$\n\nJustifying Assignments\n\nJustifying assignment: We say an assignment $a$ is justifying iff for all index sets $I$, $var(f\\vert_{x_I \\leftarrow a_I}) = var(f)\\setminus I$. In essence, replacing the variables with assignments does not kill anything but the assigned variables.\nLet there be a deterministic PIT algorithms for $(n,s,d)$ circuits. Then there exists an algorithm that returns a justifying assignment in time polynomial in $n,s, T(s,d)$ where $T(s,d)$ is the running time of the PIT algorithm.\n\nProof\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nLet $f_{i,a} = f(a_1,\\dots,a_{i-1},x_i,a_{i+1}, \\dots, a_n)$.\nWe define $f_{i,X}$ as above except that $a_j=x_j$ for all $j\\neq i$.\nWe will study $f_{i,X}(a_i) - f_{i,X}(0)$.\nWe say $a$ is a witness for $x_i$ if $f_{i,X}(a) - f_{i,X}(0) \\not\\equiv  0$ or $i\\not\\in var(f)$.\nWe say $a$ is a witness for $f$ if $a_i$ is a witness for $x_i$ for all $i$.\nNotice that a witness is not a justifying assignment, it just says that the line stays intact.\n\n\nLemma 2: $a$ is a justifying assignment if $a$ is a witness and for every $i\\in var(f)$, $f_{i,a}(a_i)-f_{i,a}(0) \\neq 0$.\n\nProof:\n\nHence, $f_{i,X}(x_i)$ is of the form $x_iP(a) + Q(a)$ where $P(a), Q(a)$ are non-zero.\nHence, it is \"justifying\" for all sets of size $n-1$ and hence justifying for all sets.\n\n\n\n\nLemma 3: Let $W\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}$ be a subset of size $d+1$ then $W^n$ contains a witness for $f$.\n\nProof:\n\nNotice that $f_{i,w}(a) - f_{i,w}(0)$ is a univariate polynomial of degree $d$.\nHence such a set needs to exist, as a univariate with degree $d$ has at most $d$ roots.\nContinue this argument for all $i\\in [n]$.\n\n\n\n\nLemma 4: For all $i\\neq j$, and $\\alpha, \\beta\\in \\mathbb{F}$, $(f_{i,X}(\\alpha) - f_{i,X}(0))\\vert_{x_j \\leftarrow \\beta} = f_{i,X}(\\alpha)\\vert_{x_j \\leftarrow \\beta} - f_{i,X}(0)\\vert_{x_j \\leftarrow \\beta}$.\n\nProof:\n\nAssume w.l.o.g. the left term has $x_j$ in it.\nThen we know that there exists $x_j$ in the final polynomial.\nHence, replacing it earlier does not cancel it.\nSimilarly in the other direction.\n\n\n\n\nLemma 5: Given $f$ and a PIT for $\\partial f$, we can find a witness for $f$ in time polynomially in $n,d,T(s,d)$.\n\nProof:\n\nFor every $i\\in [n]$, check for every $c\\in [d+1]$ if $f_{i,X}(c) - f_{i,X}(0)\\not\\equiv 0$.\nLemma 3 says we will find such an assignment and with a similar argument as in the proof, we will find it in short time.\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm:\n\nFind a witness $\\alpha$ for $f$ as in Lemma 5.\nSet $g_i=f_{i,X}(\\alpha_i) - f_{i,X}(0)$ for all $i$.\nFor $j=1,\\dots, n$ do\n\nFind a value $c$ such that for every $k\\neq j$, $g_k\\not\\equiv 0$ then $g_k\\vert_{x_j \\leftarrow c}\\not\\equiv 0$.\nSet $a_j \\leftarrow c$.\nSet $g_k \\leftarrow g_k\\vert_{x_j \\leftarrow c}$ for all $k\\neq j$.\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 2.4: The algorithm finds a justifying assignment in the usual time bounds.\n\nProof:\n\nThere are two parts of the proof as the running time is obvious.\n\nFirst:\n\nNotice that $g_i$ has degree bounded by $d$ and there are at most $n-1$ many values.\nHence at most $d(n-1)+1$ many values for $c$ have to be searched in every step.\n\n\nSecond:\n\nIf $g_i$ is non-zero in step $j$ than it is non-zero after step $j$ by construction.\n$g_i$ is initially non-zero as $\\alpha$ is a witness.\nAfter all steps, we found an assignment such that for all $i$ it holds that $f_{i,a}(\\alpha_i) - f_{i,a}(0)\\neq 0$.\nLemma 2 finishes the proof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition\nAlgorithm (given a justifying assignment $a$):\n\n$\\mathcal{I}=\\emptyset$, $J=[n]$.\nSet $x_n=a_n$ and recursively compute the variable-partition of $C\\vert_{x_n \\leftarrow a_n}$ or return the singleton set ${ { 1} }$.\nLet $\\mathcal{I}'$ be the resulting partition.\nFor every $I\\in \\mathcal{I}'$ check if $C(a)\\cdot C \\equiv C_{x_n \\leftarrow a_n} C_{x_{[n]\\setminus I} \\leftarrow a_{[n]\\setminus I}}$.\n\nIf yes, add $I$ to $\\mathcal{I}$ and set $J\\leftarrow J\\setminus I$.\nOtherwise move to the next $I$.\n\n\nAdd the remaining elements to $\\mathcal{I}$ as a single set ($\\mathcal{I}\\cup { {J}}$).\n\n\n\nLemma 3.2: Let $a$ be a justifying assignment for $f$ then for all $I$ $f(a) \\cdot f \\equiv f_{x_I\\leftarrow a_I} \\cdot f_{x_{[n]\\setminus I}\\leftarrow a_{[n]\\setminus I}}$ iff $I$ is a disjoint union of sets from the variable-partition of $f$.\n\nMeaning:\n\nNotice, that this says it could be a really bad factoring algorithm (i.e., not factoring at all).\nNotice that in the first recursion step we have $n$ as a special variable. If some variable partition $I$ is not a valid partition by this lemma, then it means it has to be in a set with $n$.\n\n\nProof:\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ (Assume equality holds)\n\nAs $a$ is a justifying assignment $f\\vert_{x_I\\leftarrow a_I}$ and $f\\vert_{x_{[n]\\setminus I} \\leftarrow a_{[n]\\setminus I}}$ are not equivalent to the zero polynomial.\nHence, $f(a)$ is not equal to zero (by equality).\nHence, $f(x) = f_{x_{[n]\\setminus I}\\leftarrow a_{[n]\\setminus I}} \\cdot f\\vert_{x_I \\leftarrow a_I}/f(a)$.\nThen the results follows by uniqueness of decomposition.\nNotice that this just says, we found a factorization (a unique factorization but not the smallest).\n\n\n$\\Leftarrow$ (decomposition to equality)\n\nWe have the decomposition $f(x)=h(X_I)g(X_{[n]\\setminus I})$.\nNow plugging in our justifying assignment results in $f\\vert_{x_I\\leftarrow a_I} = h(a) g(X_{[n]\\setminus I})$ and $f\\vert_{[n]\\setminus I \\leftarrow a_{[n]\\setminus I}} = h(X_I) g(a)$.\nHence, $f\\vert_{x_I\\leftarrow a_I} f\\vert_{[n]\\setminus I \\leftarrow a_{[n]\\setminus I}} = h(a) g(X_{[n]\\setminus I}) \\cdot  h(X_I) g(a)$.\nAnd this is equal to $f(a)f(x)$. by associativity.\nNotice, that we used here again the multilinearity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLemma 3.1: The algorithm outputs a variable partition for the polynomial computed by C\n\nProof:\n\nProof by induction.\nThe base case is clear as a univariate multilinear polynomial does not have factors.\nLet $C=h_1(X_{I_1}) \\cdots h_k(X_{I_k})$. where $\\mathcal{I}={ I_1,\\dots, I_k}$ the correct partition.\nAssume w.l.o.g. that $n\\in I_k$.\nNow $C_{x_n\\leftarrow a_n} = h_1\\cdots h_{k-1} h_k\\vert_{x_n\\leftarrow a_n}$ by justifying.\nNow we can use our induction hypothesis on $C_{x_n\\leftarrow a_n}$.\n\nNotice that this could have factors $h_k\\vert_{x_n\\leftarrow a_n} = g_1\\cdots g_l$\nHowever, we will use the induction hypothesis on $C_{x_n\\leftarrow a_n}$.\n\n\nThis gives us then a partition (not variable partition) $I_1,\\dots, I_{k-1}, I_{k,1},\\dots, I_{k,l}$.\nBy Lemma 3.2 $I_1,\\dots,I_{k-1}$ will be added, however $I_{k,1},\\dots,I_{k,l}$ will not be added (as $\\mathcal{I}$ was already the partition).\nThe runtime if obvious from the algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\nProof of the Theorem\n\nThe proof is now simple.\nBy Theorem 2.4 we can compute a justifying assignment (notice that he PIT also works for the derivative) and the number of variables.\nLemma 3.1 gives us the variable partition.\nHence, for every $I$ we see $\\alpha y^m h_I = C\\vert_{x_{[n]\\setminus I} \\leftarrow a_{[n]\\setminus I}}$ for some $m$.\nA simple interpolation gives us $h_I$.\n\n\n\nKopparty, Saraf, Shpilka\nRough Overview of the Kaltofen Factorization Algorithm (reducing multivariate factorization to univariate factorization)\n\nInitialization:\n\nAssume $f(x,y)$.\nAssume $f$ is monic, i.e., highest degree coefficient is one.\nAssume $f(x,0)$ is square free.\n\n\nUnivariate Factoring:\n\nFactor $f(x,0)$ as a univariate polynomial into $g(x,0)\\cdot h(x,0)$.\nVarious algorithms such as LLL and others.\n\n\nLifting:\n\nLift the factors by the following theorem:\nLet $R=\\mathbb{F}(x)[y]$ and $I=y^{2^i}R$ and let $f=g\\cdot h\\mod I$ and $a,b\\in R$ such that $ag+bh=1\\mod I$. Then we can efficiently compute $g',h'$ such that $f=g'h' \\mod I^2$ and $g=g'\\mod I$, $h=h'\\mod I$.\nNow we use this to compute polynomials $g_i(x,y), h_i(x,y)$ such that $f(x,y) = g_i(x,y)h_i(x,y) \\mod y^{2^i}$.\nNotice that we essentially started with the factors $f(x,y)=g(x,y)h(x,y)\\mod y$.\n\n\nReducing the degree:\n\nWe continue until we are at $y^{4d^2}$.\nNow $g_k$ divides(modulo $y^{4d^2}$) another low degree polynomial that has a common factor with $f$.\nCompute $g'$ such that $g'=g_k r \\mod y^{4d^2}$ such that $\\deg_x(g') &lt; \\deg_x(f)$ and $\\deg_y(g')\\leq \\deg_y(f)$.\nDo this by solving linear equation system.\nThis system is solvable as $g=g_k r_k \\mod y^{4d^2}$.\n\n\nComputing a non-trivial factor:\n\nCompute $\\gcd(f,g')$.\nOne can show (with the resultant) that this has always a non-trivial gcd.\nContinue now by induction on the factors.\n\n\nExtending this to multivariate case:\n\nTake $f(x,y_1,\\dots,y_n)$ and take it as $f(x,\\alpha_1 + \\beta_1 t,\\dots, \\alpha_n t+\\beta_n)$ in $\\mathbb{F}(\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n)[x,t]$ for some random subspace.\nEffective Hilbert Theorem: $\\Pr_{\\alpha,\\beta}[f(x,\\alpha_1t+\\beta_1,\\dots,\\alpha_nt+\\beta_n) \\text{ is not irreducible}] \\leq O(\\frac{d^5}{\\lvert S\\rvert})$.\nEffective and efficient Hilber Theorem: We can even compute a polynomial $h(z_1,\\dots,z_n,y_1,\\dots,y_n)$ such that $h(\\alpha,\\beta)\\neq 0$ iff $f$ is irreducible (follows form the proof of the effective hilbert theorem).\n\nThis is were we use our blackbox/hitting set for, i.e., one of our elements in the hitting set will be enough without needing to compute $h$.\n\n\nWith high probability this restriction is enough (Effective Hilbert irreducibility).\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\nPolynomial sized circuits with polynomial degree on $n$ variables.\nPIT: Is such a circuit identically to the zero polynomial.\nPIT produce circuit lower bounds (boolean or algebraic) and the other way around.\nFactoring: Compute irreducible factors of $f$.\nDepth of a circuit.\n$(n,s,d)$ circuit with $n$ variables, size $s$ and degree $d$.\nDegree of multivariate polynomial is the total degree.\nTheorem: Let $\\mathbb{F}$ be a finite field or the rationals $\\mathbb{Q}$.

By Induction Hypothesis both are full.\nIf we are in the multiplication gate $v= v_1 \\cdot v_2$ then by induction hypothesis, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are full, hence their sets $I_{v_1}$, $I_{v_2}$ are given by all monomials.\nLet us look at the monomial $m_1\\in v_1$ and $m_2\\in v_2$.\nTheir index set is $I_{v_1}\\cup I_{v_2}$.

Then $R_{k-1} = W_k$.\nRolle's Theorem: Let $f(a)=f(b)$ and continuous and differentiable, then there exists $c$ such that $f'(c)=0$.\nInduction on $i$ with hypothesis: $R_i$ has at least $Z(f_1+ \\dots + f_k) - i - Z(W_i) - 2\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} Z(W_j)$ many real roots.\nWe want to get analyse the roots of $\\frac{R_i}{W_{i+1}}$.\nLet us define, where $m_x(F)$ is the multiplicity of the root in $F$:\n\n$Z_i^+ = #{ x \\mid m_x(R_i) &gt; m_x(W_{i+1}) &gt;0 }$.\n$Z_i^= = #{ x \\mid m_x(R_i) = m_x(W_{i+1}) &gt;0 }$.\n$Z_i^- = #{ x \\mid 0&lt; m_x(R_i) &lt; m_x(W_{i+1}) }$.\n$Z_i^{-0} = #{ x \\mid 0= m_x(R_i) &lt; m_x(W_{i+1}) }$.\n\n\nThis list is exhaustive and hence $Z(W_{i+1}) = Z_i^+ + Z_i^= + Z_i^- + Z_i^{-0}$ (as we only look at roots that for $W_{i+1}$).\nLet $F$ be the number of zeros of $R_i$. Then\n$Z(\\frac{R_i}{W_{i+1}}) \\geq  F- Z_i^= - Z_i^-$.\nWe have poles (where the value goes to infinite) at $Z_i^-$, $Z_i^{-0}$.\nRolle's Theorem, says: between every two of our zeroes there is a place where the derivated function is zero.\nHence $Z(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\frac{R_i}{W_{i+1}}) = F-Z_i^= - Z_i^- -1$ but this is not correct. I also have to subtract $Z_i^-+Z_i^{-0}$ as these could match with non-poles on the other size.\nHence the overall is $F-Z_i^= - Z_i^- - 1 - Z_i^- - Z_i^{-0}$.\nNow we can figure out the number of roots of $\\frac{W^2_{i+1}}{W_i} \\partial \\frac{R_i}{W_{i+1}}$.\nNumber of zeroes is just added, hence $(F-Z_i^= - Z_i^- - 1 - Z_i^- - Z_i^{-0}) + Z_i^- - Z(W_i))$\nThe reason is that by the following argument, we get at least one zero for every $x$ that is in $Z_i^-$. Is this just an obvious lower bound?\nWe use the fact that if $0&lt; m_x(R_i) &lt; m_x(W_{i+1})$ then $W_{i+1}^2$ grows faster to zero than $1/W_{i+1}$ and hence there is a root at $W_{i+1}^2 \\cdot \\partial (\\frac{R_i}{W_{i+1}})$.\nHence, we get $Z(f_1+ \\dots + f_k) - i - Z(W_i) - 2\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} Z(W_j) -Z_i^= - Z_i^- -1 - Z_i^- -Z_i^{-0} + Z_i^- - Z(W_i)$.\nUsing the equality for $Z(W_{i+1})=Z_i^+ + Z_i^= + Z_i^- + Z_i^{-0}$ i.e., ($-Z(W_{i+1}) + Z_i^+= -Z_i^- -Z_i^= - Z_i^{-0})$ gives us\n$Z(f_1 + \\dots + f_k) - (i+1) - 2\\sum_{j=1}^i Z(W_j) - Z(W_{i+1}) + Z_i^+$ which gives us the required lower bound.\n\nKoiran, Portier, Tavenas, Thomasse - A $\\tau$-conjecture for Newton Polygons\n\nLet $f$ be a bivariate polynomial.

This is then implied by $\\det(D_t(0))\\neq 0$.\nAs every entry in $M$ has degree one and $\\det(M)$ has degree $n$, $m\\geq n$.\n\n\nHence, $D_{n-2}$ is invertible.\nLet $M=\\begin{pmatrix} A&amp; B\\ C&amp; D\\end{pmatrix}$.\nBy Lemma 3.8 $\\det(M) = \\det(A-BD^{-1}C) \\det(D)$.\nSince $D^{-1} = adj(D)/\\det(D)$ where $adj(D)$ is the adjugate of $D$.\n\nThe adjugate is given by: the entry of $\\adj(A)_{i,j}$ is the $j,i$th minor of $A$ times $(-1)^{i+j}$.\n\n\nNow the entries of $D^{-1}$ can be written a a ratio of two polynomials where the denominator has degree at most $n-2$ and the numerator has degree at most $n-3$.\n\nAs the minor removes at least one row/column and hence one linear form.\n\n\nNow the entries of $A-BD^{-1}C$ are given by polynomials with the following maximum degree (in order) $1,1, n-3/n-2, 1$.\nThis gives us that the entries have degree $1+n-3+1$ in the numerator and $n-2$ in the denominator.\nThis also implies that $A-BD^{-1}C$ is a $(m-n+2) \\times (m-n+2)$ matrix.\n\nThe reason is that $\\det(M)$ is a degree $m$ polynomial and $\\det(D)$ is a degree $n-1$ polynomial.\nHence, $\\det(A-BD^{-1}C$ has to produce a degree $m-n+2$ polynomial.\nAs $A,B,C$ have only linear forms, this means the matrix size has to be at least $(m-n+2) \\times (m-n+2)$.\n\n\nThe denominator now gets cleared by the additional multiplication of $\\det(D)$.\nHence, we can have a matrix $N$ that is givey by $(A-BD^{-1}C) \\det(D)$ that has entries of degree at most $n-1$.\nLet $\\det(D)=1+Q$.\nThen we can write $\\det(M) (1+Q)^{m-n+2} = \\det(N) (1+Q)$ where $N$ is the matrix $A-BD^{-1}C$ multiplied every entry with $1+Q$.\n\nThis follows from the dimension of $A-BD^{-1}C$.\n\n\nSimplifying further gives us $(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^n)(1+Q)^{m-n+1} = \\det(N)$.\n\nUsing the fact that $\\det(M)=f$.\n\n\nThis gives us the bound, provided we show that the constant part of $N$ at position $0,0$ is zero and one on the diagonal.\nI am skipping this part.\n\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2020/lowerbound-determinant/","title":"A Lower Bound on Determinantal Complexity"},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2020/lowerbounds-25power/":{"body":"Communication Complexity\nDutta, Saxena, Thierauf - Lower bounds on the sum of 25th-powers of univariates lead to complete derandomization of PIT\nMain Result\n\nWe will only look at univariate polynomials.\n$f$ is computed by sum of $r$th power if $f=\\sum_{i=1}^s c_i l_i^r$ where $l_i$ are polynomials.\nSupport Union size is $\\lvert \\cup_{i=1}^s supp(l_i)$, here supp is the non-zero polynomials in $l_i$.\nWe denote this measure by $U(f,r,s)$.\n$U(f,r,s)\\geq \\Omega(|supp(f)|^{1/r})$ by trivial counting argument.\nLet us study $f=(x+1)^d$.\n\nFor $s=1$, if $r | d$ then $U(f,r,s)\\leq d/r +1$.\nFor $s=2$, $U(f,r,s)\\geq d/r+1$ (Theorem 25).\nFor $s=r+1$ and any $d$, $U(f,r,r+1)\\leq d/r+1$ (Lemma 21).\nFor $s\\geq c(d+1)$, $c&gt;r$ $U(f,r,s)\\leq O(d^{1/r})$.\n\n\nConjecture 1: $U(f,r,d^\\delta) \\geq d/r^{\\delta'}$ for large enough $d$ and constants $\\delta\\leq 1 \\leq \\delta'$.\nTheorem 1: If Conjecture 1 holds then blackbox PIT is in P.\n\nProof Idea:\nConstruct a $k$-variate polynomial from $f$.\nShow that the above polynomial is hard assuming Conjecture 1.\nThis hardness will translate to an efficient hitting set for VP.\nDetails:\n\nThe first part will use an inverse kronecker substitution.\n$P(x_1,\\dots,x_n) \\rightarrow P(x^{(n+1)^0},\\dots,x^{(n+1)^{k-1}})=f(x)$.\nThis map is a bijection between supp(P) and supp(f).\nNow we prove that size(P)$&gt;d^{1/\\mu}$ for some constant $\\mu&gt;1$.\nIf $f$ would not have that size, then cut the circuit at a specific layer.\n\nConvert it to $\\sum\\prod$ for the top and bottom layer.\nThen we can write it as $\\sum c_i g_i^r$ circuit with at most $d^{\\delta}$ summands and support-union bounded by $d/r^{\\delta'}$.\nThis would contradict Conjecture 1.\n\n\n$r\\geq 25$ is required because:\n\nSupport-union size $\\binom{k+kn/2}{k}&gt;(n+1)^k &gt; d$ instead of $d/r^{\\delta'}$.\nThis would not give a contradiction.\n\n\nThe polynomial $P$ is actually explicit.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting things to know\n\nFischer Formula:\n\n$g=\\prod_{i\\in [m]} g_i$ can be written as $g=\\sum_{i\\in [2^m]} c_j h_j^m$ where $h_j\\in span(g_i \\mid i\\in [m])$.\n\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2020/lowerbounds-25power/","title":"Lower bounds on the sum of 25th-powers of univariates lead to complete derandomization of PIT"},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2020/monotone-lowerbounds-from-communication/":{"body":"Paper\n\nChattopadhyay, Datta, Mukhopadhyay - Lower Bounds for Monotone Arithmetic Circuits via Communication Complexity\nWhile the paper uses probabilities that are scaled by their support to always be correct, we will ignore this scaling for clarity.

If this satisfies $W(H\\cap \\mathcal{K}(f^{-1}(z))) \\leq \\eta /3 W(H)$. Then $W(H)\\leq \\Omega(2^{-\\min Corr_{\\lambda,\\eta}^z}(f\\circ XOR))$.\n\nProof:\nLet $u=\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace ^m$, $\\tilde \\alpha[u] = \\sum_{\\kappa \\in \\oplus(\\kappa)=u} \\alpha[\\kappa]$. We sum over all coefficients of monomials that have the parity vector equal to $m$.\nHence, we can write $\\alpha \\beta$ as $\\left(\\sum_{u\\in \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace ^m} \\sum_{\\kappa \\in \\oplus(\\kappa)=u} \\alpha[\\kappa] \\kappa \\right) \\cdot \\left(\\sum_{v\\in \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace ^m} \\sum_{\\kappa' \\in \\oplus(\\kappa')=u} \\beta[\\kappa'] \\kappa \\right)$.\nThis is equal to $\\sum_{x\\in \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace ^m} \\left( \\sum_{u\\in \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace ^m} \\left( \\sum_{\\kappa \\in \\oplus(\\kappa)=u} \\alpha[\\kappa] \\kappa \\right) \\cdot  \\left( \\sum_{\\kappa' \\in \\oplus(\\kappa')=u\\oplus x} \\beta[\\kappa'] \\kappa' \\right) \\right)$ as we can obviously replace $w$ with a xor with $u$.\nFor the next notice that our measure on this is equal to $\\sum_{x\\in \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace ^m} \\sum_{\\kappa \\in \\oplus(\\kappa)=u} \\sum_{\\kappa \\in \\oplus(\\kappa')=u\\oplus x} W(\\kappa)\\cdot \\kappa'$ if we ignore coefficients.\n\nBut this is now equal to (by abusing notation a lot) $W(u\\oplus (u\\oplus x))$. Notice that $W(m\\cdot m')$ with vectors $\\oplus(m)=u,\\oplus(m')=u'$ is exactly $u\\oplus u'$.\n\n\nHence, we can write this as $W(\\alpha \\beta) = \\sum_{x\\in \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace ^m} W(\\kappa'') \\left(\\sum_{u\\in \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace ^m} \\left(\\sum_{\\kappa \\in \\oplus(\\kappa)=u} \\alpha[\\kappa]\\right) \\left(\\sum_{\\kappa' \\in \\oplus(\\kappa)=u'} \\beta[\\kappa']\\right)\\right)$ where $W(\\kappa'')=x$.\nNow with our new notation this is equal to $\\sum_{x\\in \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace ^m} W(\\kappa'') \\sum_{u\\in \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace } \\tilde\\alpha[u] \\tilde\\beta[u\\oplus x]$.\nWe denote this sum as $W(\\tilde\\alpha,\\tilde\\beta)$ and $W_z(\\tilde w\\alpha, \\tilde\\beta)$ if we enforce that $f(x)=z$.\nThere is a optimization problem $B$ which maximizes $\\tilde W(\\alpha,\\beta)$ with constraints $0\\leq \\alpha[u] \\leq 4m^{\\lvert I(\\alpha)\\rvert}$ and similar for $\\beta[v]$.\n\nThis follows from a corollary I skip.\n\n\nFor an optimal solution to $B$, we can see that all except one $\\alpha^{*},\\beta^{*}$ have to be either $0$ or $4m^{\\lvert I(\\alpha)\\rvert}$ ($\\beta$, respectively).\nNow we can define a rectangle that is all $u,v$ such that $\\alpha[u]\\neq 0$ and $\\beta[v]\\neq 0$ and removing the optimal solution.\nHence, we can bound the overall weight by the following sums: The sum of all $u,v$ in the rectangle, the sum of $v$ outside the rectangle and $u$ arbitrary and the sum of $u$ outside the rectangle and $u$ arbitrary.\n\nWe upper bound the last two by using the optimal solution, i.e., $u^{*}$ and $v^{*}$.\nThe optimal solution might be a good upper bound already but does not have anything to do with the rectangle.\n\n\nThis is just $\\sum_{u\\in A,v\\in B} \\alpha^{*}[u]\\beta^{*}[v] W(u\\oplus v)$. The rest follows from the upper bounds given by our optimization program and and inserting the definition of the measure.\nThe other two summation can be upper bounded in a similar fashion where the sum over $W(u^{*} \\oplus v)$ is upper bounded by $1$ as $\\mu$ is a probability measure.\n\n\nCorollary 4.1\n\nConstruction of depth 3 formulas monotone lowerbound\n\nWe look at the function $SINK \\circ XOR$.\nWe define the distribution $\\mu$ as follows:\n\nWith probability $1/2$ sample a vertex $i\\in [k]$ at random and sample randomly an $x$ under the condition that $i$ is a sink. Otherwise, with probability $1/2$ sample $x$ at random.\n\n\nDefine $\\lambda =\\mu(x\\oplus y)$.\nTheorem 5.2 (Lemma from [CMS20]): Corr$_{\\lambda,\\mu}^1(SINK\\circ XOR) =

That Card in Mind: Card Guessing with Limited Memory.pdf\npaper\nResults\nSetup\n\nA Dealer deals cards via some strategy from a set of cards labeled by $1,\\dots,n$.\nGuesser has to guess which card is dealt.\nA guesser with perfect memory can guess $\\ln n$ correct guesses.\n\nThe guesser remembers which cards are played and picks randomly from the remaining cards.\n\n\nWith no memory, the guesser can guess only 1 in expectation.\n\nResults\n\nGuesser with $O(\\log^2 n)$ bits has a near optimal result (static or random shuffle).\nNo Guesser with $m$ bits of memory can score better than $O(\\sqrt{m})$ correct guesses.\nThere exists an adaptive dealer for which no guesser with memory $m$ can make more than $\\ln m + 2\\ln \\log n + O(1)$ correct guesses in expectation.\n\nOverview of Proofs\n\nMain result:\n\nThe guesser tracks from which cards were drawn from multiple subsets.\nEvery subset card in the subset is \"tracked\" by at most $2\\log n$ bits.\nGuesser can recover the last card that has not appeared in each subset and guesses it.\nSubsets are build incrementally such that the $i$th subset contains the $i+1$th.\n\n\nLower Bound:\n\nThe lower bound is proven by using correct guesses to encode an ordered set.\nThe encoding simulates the game and the bottom is the ordered set we wish to encode.\nIf sufficiently many correct guesses occur we store what is required to encode this game.\nThis gives us the set.\nWe store:\n\nThe memory state of the guesser\nThe set of turns it predicted correctly\nThe cards the dealer draws in the other turns with their order.\n\n\nThe memory saving is from turns predicted correctly + state of the guesser.\nWe also fix the randomness of the guesser overall (not per set) to make this deterministic.\n\n\n\nSimple Strategies\n\nSubset Guessing:\n\nChose a random or predetermined subset of cards $A\\in \\binom{[n]}{m}$.\nEvery turn the guesser guesses one card in $A$ that not yet has occured.\nThis requires $m$ bits to store.\nCounting the turns in which the dealer draws cards from $A$ we get that the guesser makes $\\ln m$ correct guesses.\n$1/n + 1/(n-1) + 1/(n-2) + \\dots + 1/2 + 1$.\nThis works against any dealer as these cards have to be drawn at some point in the game.\nBecause we can predetermine the set and the above fact we do not need to store a description of the set.\n\n\nRemembering last $k$ cards:\n\nGuess the last card by storing the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^n i$ and subtract the card shown.\nThis generalizes via chinese remainder to $k$ cards.\nStore $\\sum_{i=1}^n i^p \\mod n$ for $p=1,\\dots, k$ and remove $d^p$ for the shown card $d$.\nThis requires $k\\log n$ bits.\nAs the set of the last cards is now know, we make $\\ln k$ correct guesses.\nThis works against any dealer.\n\n\n\nLess Simple Strategy\n\nFor certain subsets $S_1,\\dots,$ store the number of cards seen from this subset and the number as in the remembering last $k$ cards.\nThe sets will be $[1,2], [1,2,3,4], \\dots, [1,\\dots,n]$.\nProof:\n\nCall a set $S_i = [1,\\dots,w]$ useful if the last card that appears in it does not appear in the next subset $S_{i+1}$.\nEvery subset will contribute a correct guess but it could be that the same guess comes from multiple subsets.\nNot so if the subset is useful.\nThe probability that a subset is useful is $(2w-w)/2w$.\nHence, the expected number of useful sets is $\\log n/2$.\n\n\n\nLower Bound Argument\n\nAny Guesser using $m$ bits of memory can get at most $O(\\min { \\ln n, \\sqrt{m}})$ correct guesses in expectation against random shuffle dealer.\nCompression Argument:\n\nEncoding function for ordered set $B$:\n\nSimulate the guesser on a deck of cards where the last $k$ cards are $B$ (including order).\nRecord the memory of the guesser $m$ bits after the first $n-k$ cards.\nIf the guesser gives $\\ell$ correct guesses than we supply the remaining $k-\\ell$ guesses (without position).\nWe note the positions where the guesser was correct.\nThis gives us a size of $m + \\log \\binom{k}{\\ell} + \\log (\\prod_{i=0}^{k-\\ell-1} n-i)$.\nThe number of ordered sets is $\\prod_{i=0}^{k-1} n-i$.\nThe probability over the choices of $B$ for any correct guess beyond $\\frac{m+1}{\\beta \\ln n}$ drops exponentially.\n\nThis comes from comparing the encoding size with the size of the ordered sets.\n\n\nNow we can use the following Lemma (2.1.5) and prefix freeness of the constructed code.\nFor every encoding function the probability that the encoding is $d$ bits less than its entropy is at most $2^{-d}$.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Results\n\nFor every $m$ there exists an adaptive dealer such that any guesser makes at most $\\ln m + 2\\ln \\log n + O(1)$ correct guesses.\n\nQuestions\n\nAll of them seem to have a low probability for some cards.\nSo can we make a guesser that will have a non negligable probability on all dealers?\n\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2021/dealer-guesser/","title":"Keep that card in

polynomial and assumed to be 1.\nThe polynomial is given as ordered over $u$ in the paper.\n$ST(G)$ can be computed by an ABP via determinant.\nLet $G$ be a $d$-regular expander, then every monotone circuit for $ST(G)$ has size at least $2^{\\Omega(n)}$.\n\nProof\nPrerequisites\n\nExpander Mixing Lemma: Let $G$ be an undirected $d$ regular graph such that $\\gamma_2$, the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. Then for every set $S,T$ $| |E(S,T)| -\\frac{d}{n} |S| |T| | \\leq \\gamma_2 \\sqrt{|S| |T|}$.\n\n$E(S,T)$ is the edges in the cut of $S,T$.\n\n\nMatrix Tree Theorem: Let $G$ be an undirected graph and $0,\\mu_1,\\dots,\\mu_{n-1}$ be the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of $G$. Then the number of spanning trees is $1/n \\mu_1 \\cdots \\mu_{n-1}$.\nTheorem 2.1 (Yeh19): Let $p$ be a monotone polynomial. Then we can write $p=\\sum_{t=1}^s a_t b_t$ with $n/3\\leq \\supp(a_t) \\leq 2n/3$ and $\\supp(b_t) = [n]\\setminus \\supp(a_t)$.\n\nHere, supp is the variables occurring in the polynomial.\nMoreover, the coefficients of any monomial in $a_t b_t$ is bounded by the coefficient of the same monomial in $p$.\n\n\n\nProof\n\nWe can look at the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^s a_i b_i$ into buckets.\nLet $X_t={x_{t,i} \\mid x_{t,i}\\in \\supp(a_i)\\cup \\supp(b_i)}$.\nOur buckets now make the computation look like this $\\sum_{i=1}^{s/(n-1)} \\sum_{t=2}^n a'_i b'_i$.\nLet us study one of the buckets, by fixing $s$ arbitrarily.\nWe want to have an upper bound of $\\sum_{t=2}^n |X_t|$.\n\nThis will give us a lower bound on the size, as we will count the monomials for this fixed $s$.\nIf $x_{i,i'}\\in \\supp(a_s)$ and $x_{j,j'}\\in \\supp(b_s)$ then not $x_{i,j}$ and $x_{j,i}$ can be in $\\cup_{t=2}^n X_t$.\n\nOtherwise, $x_{i,j}\\in \\supp(a_s)$ and $x_{j,i}\\in \\supp(b_s)$.\nOtherwise $x_{i,j}x_{j,i}$ would be contained in a monomial of $a_s b_s$.\nThis is a cycle and hence not allowed in a spanning tree.\nNotice that $x_{i,j}$ and $x_{j,i}$ are in $X_i,X_j$ respectively.\n\n\nThis means that at least one of the two directed edges must be absent in $\\cup_{t=2}^n X_t$.\nHence, $\\sum_{t=2}^n |X_t| \\geq dn - E(a_s,b_s)$ where $E(a_s,b_s)$ is the set of undirected edges.\n\nThe number of monomials is given by $dn$ for the whole graph.\nExcept we have $E(a_s,b_s)$ removed from this because one edge is missing from this for every undirected edge this has.\n\n\nSetting $|a_s|,|b_s| \\geq n/3$ and $|a_s|+|b_s| =n$ and the expander Lemma we get\n$|E(a_s,b_s)| \\geq d/n n^2/9 - \\lambda_2 n/2 = n(d/9 - \\lambda_2/2)$.\nThis gives us the number of monomials for one fixed $s$, namely $\\leq 1.01d(1-\\alpha)^{n-1}$ for a constant $\\alpha$.\nAs the number of monomials in a spanning tree is (in our case) $1/n(d-\\lambda_2)^{n-1}$.\nOur bound is now $(1/n (d-\\lambda_2)^{n-1})/ 1.01(1-\\alpha)^{n-1}$ which is exponential.\n\n\n\nInteresting Open Problems\n\nIs there an explicit polynomial computable by a formula that has exponential monotone circuits?\n\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2021/montone-spanning-tree-polynomial/","title":"Montone Complexity of Spanning Tree Polynomial Re-visited"},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2021/randomized-computation/":{"body":"2021-07-25-MD-Tight Bounds for the Randomized and Quantum Communication Complexities of Equality with Small Error\npaper\nResults\n\nI am only going to cover the convertion between public coin protocols to private coin protocols.\nThis is an improvement over the original Newman's Theorem.\nTheorem (Neumann): $R_{\\epsilon +\\delta}^{priv}(F) \\leq R_\\epsilon^{pub}(F) + \\log n/\\delta^2 + O(1)$.\nResult: $\\forall \\epsilon,\\delta$ in sufficient ranges $R_{\\epsilon (1 +\\delta)}^{priv}(F) \\leq R_\\epsilon^{pub}(F) + \\log n/\\epsilon + \\log 6/\\delta^2$.\n\nThis follows similar to Neumann but uses a multiplicative Chernoff bound instead of an additive one.\nThis seems like a good way to get familiar with this proof.\n\n\n\nProof\n\nLet $\\Pi$ be a protocol that computes $F$ with error $\\epsilon$.\nSet $B=6n/\\delta^2\\epsilon$.\nIndependently choose random strings $r_1,\\dots,r_B$ according to the distribution used by $\\Pi$.\nLet $I_{j,x,y}$ denote the indicator that $r_j$ is a bad random string for $x,y$.\nFix two arbitrary inputs $x,y$.

Then $H(X_i \\mid g_1(X),\\dots, g_m(X)) \\leq 1+ \\Pr[X^{\\oplus 1}\\not\\in D] - 2^{-O(q)}$ where $D$ is the domain of the function $f$.\n\n\n\nProof for $q=1$\n\nProposition 5.1\n\n$H[X_i] - H[X_i \\mid g_1(X),\\dots,g_m(X)]=1$.\nI.e., the output of the inner functions determine $X_i$ completely.\nProof:\n\nAssume wlog that the only function querying $X_i$ is $g_1$.\nNow we want to recover $x_i$ from $g_1,\\dots,g_m$.\nBy our assumption $\\lvert x\\rvert=h(g_1,\\dots,g_m)$.\nSo $\\lvert x\\rvert$ is given either by $h(0,g_2,\\dots,g_m)$ or $h(1,g_2,\\dots,g_m)$.\nNow look at $x^{\\oplus i}$. This does not change $g_2,\\dots,g_m$ because we choose $q=1$.\nAs this changes the hamming weight of the output, it means that $g_1$ flips when $x_i$ flips.\nHence, as everything else is fixed (because the $g_i$ are local), this is the only bit of information.\nNotice that we have the computation of $g_1,\\dots,g_m$ given.\nNow compare $h(g_1,\\dots,g_m)$ vs the hamming weight of $x^{i-&gt;0}$ and $x^{i-&gt;1}$.\nOne of them will fit with the computed hamming weight of $h$ and, hence, be the correct one.\nHence, we completely recovered $X_i$.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Case:\n\nLet $J_i$ be the set of inner functions that depend on variable $i$.\nNow $H[X_i \\mid g_1(X),\\dots,g_m(X)]\\leq H[X_i \\mid { g_j(X) \\mid j\\in \\bar J_i}, \\lvert X\\rvert]$, i.e., the all the functions that don't depend on $i$.\n\nThis is ok because $g_1,\\dots,g_m$ determine $\\lvert X\\rvert$ completely.\nHence, this is potentially only more information but not less we are given.\n\n\nThis is now by definition $E_{Y\\sim D}[-\\log \\Pr[X_i=Y_i\\mid (\\forall j\\in \\bar J_i, g_j(X)=g_j(Y)) \\land \\lvert X\\rvert = \\lvert Y\\rvert)]]$.\nThis is equal to $E_{Y\\sim D}[H_2(\\Pr[X_i=Y_i\\mid (\\forall j\\in \\bar J_i, g_j(X)=g_j(Y)) \\land \\lvert X\\rvert = \\lvert Y\\rvert)])]$ where this is the binary entropy function, i.e., $-p\\log p - (1-p)\\log (1-p)$.\nNow we need to bound this by $1+\\Pr[X^{\\oplus i}\\not \\in D] -2^{-O(q)}$.\nNow we prove this inequality.\n\nFix output values by $v\\in {0,1}^{\\bar J_i}$ of the inner functions that do not query variable $i$.\nSuppose these output values are achievable by some input $x\\in D$.\nDefine $S_v = { x \\mid \\forall j\\in \\bar J_i, g_j(x)=v_j }$ the set of inputs that produce the values for the inner functions.\nThis $S_v$ partitions the distribution $D$.\nWe call a $v$ good if $\\Pr[X^{\\plus i}\\not\\in D \\mid X\\in S_v]\\leq 2\\Pr[X^{\\oplus i}\\not\\in D]$.\nBy Markov, the sets $S_v$ with good $v$ account for at most probablity mass, i.e., $\\sum_{v \\text{is good}} \\Pr[X\\in S_v] \\geq 1/2$.\nNow we show that our required equation holds for every good $v$.\nLet $W_v$ be the set of possible hamming weights with $x\\in D\\cap S_v$.\nIt can only depend on the remaining $q$ input values $g_j(x)$ for $j\\in J_i$.\nNow we want to have that there exists a Hamming Weight that occurs with significant probability within $S_v$ such that conditioned on this we can guess $X_i=1$ with better than random chance.\nTo prove (1): $\\Pr[\\lvert X\\rvert =w^* \\mid x\\in S_v]\\geq 2^{-O(q)}$\nTo Prove (2): $\\Pr[X_i=1 \\mid X\\in S_v\\cap \\lvert X\\rvert=w^*]\\leq 1/2 - 2^{O(q)}$.\nThis implies our equation by simple calculations which we skip.\nTo find this $w^*$ we know:\n\nIf $x\\in S_v$ then $x^{\\oplus i}\\in S_v$. This gives us a naive pairing of values in $S_v$.\nNow define $p_w = \\Pr[X^{\\oplus i}\\in D, \\lvert X^{i-&gt; 0}\\rvert = w \\mid X\\in S_v]$.\nThis has at most $2\\lvert W_v\\rvert$ non-zero elements.\nThe total sum is at least $1-2^{-10q+1}$\nThe maximum is at least $2^{-q-2}$.\nSo there exists a weight $w*$ such that $p_{w^} \\geq p_{w^-1} + 2^{-2q-3}$.\nThis $w^*$ turns out to satisfy the equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the Lemma does not automatically say anything about if this is possible or not.\n\nThis only gives a contradiction if this lemma gives us more information via $I[X_i \\mid g_1,\\dots,g_m]$ then $I[g_1(X),\\dots,g_m(X)]$.\nFor majority, the Lemma gives $\\Omega(n)$ information but $n&gt;&gt;m$ which is the information of the $g_i$.\nLooking at Parity, the\n\n\n\nObservations\n\nNotice that the lemma does not work for Parity and similar things.\n\nThe reason can be seen in the $q=1$ case.\nHere given $g_1,\\dots,g_m$ we can still get $x_i \\oplus 0$ and $x_i \\oplus 1$.\nIn the Hamming Weight case I can check if the Hamming weight goes up or down with the bit flip.\nWith Parity it will always flip.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nCan we improve this to not just be on hamming weight function, i.e., functions that are a bit different then what they say?\nUNCHECKED Can we improve this to other functions?\nUNCHECKED Does this work for monotone symmetric functions?\n\nOne thing I am not sure is if I can always reconstruct it.\nCan it happen that we do not get any response/difference?\nIn the simple case not but the other case is more difficult.\n\n\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2022/the-composition-complexity-of-majority/","title":"The Composition Complexity of Majority"},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2022/token-sliding/":{"body":"Paper\nAvis, Hoang - On Reconfiguration Graph of Independent Sets under Token Sliding\nSetup\n\nPut a token on one vertex of every independent set of a given graph $G$.\nTokens can slide to neighbours that are not occupied.\nConstruct a new graph $G'$ in the following way: Two vertices are adjacent if we can slide one token to one of its adjacent vertices.\nThis is called TS or TS$_k$ if we restrict ourselves to independent sets of size $k$.\nQuestions:\n\nDoes TS$_k(G)$ belong to some graph class?\nIf $G$ satisfies some property, does $TS(G)$ also satisfy the property and vice versa?\n\n\n\nResults\n\nTS_k($\\bar G$) is a subgraph of the graph whose nodes are size $k$ cliques and two nodes are adjacent if they have exactly $k-1$ vertices in common.\nIf $H$ is an induced subgraph of $G$ then TS$_k(H)$ is an induced subgraph of TS$_k(G)$ (but not the reverse).\nTS$(P_n)$ is planar for every $n\\leq 8$ but non-planar otherwise (where $P_n$ is a planar graph on $n$ vertices),\nMore similar results.\n\n","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2022/token-sliding/","title":"On Reconfiguration Graph of Independent Sets under Token Sliding"},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2023/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2023/","title":""},"https://narfinger.github.io/posts/2023/reading/":{"body":"Paper 1\n\nGolovnev, Gur, Shinkar - Derandomization of Cell Sampling\n\nResult\n\nPreviously there was a problem on $n$ inputs and $m$ possible queries:\n\nSuch that any data structure that answers queries by probing $t$ memory cells requires space $s\\geq \\tilde \\Omega(n (m/n)^{1/t})$\n\n\nThis paper improves this to $s\\geq \\tilde\\Omega(n (m/n)^{1/(t-1)})$ for $t\\geq 2$ for non-adaptive data structures.\n\nProof\n\nTheorem: Let $G$ be a large enough $t$-hypergraph with at least $|V| (1+\\epsilon)$ edges for large enough $\\epsilon$.
